            I'm taking this route for the first time â€“ what fare should I offer?

            Try a fare 20% lower than other ride-hailing services. That's usually how much you save with E-ride. If your offer's too low, we'll let you know. In some areas, the app recommends a fare based on your route.

            How are passenger ratings calculated?

          <p>
            Ratings are based on ride history. Fake orders, complaints, and unpaid rides can all lower ratings.
